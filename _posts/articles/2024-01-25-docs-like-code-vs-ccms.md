Choosing 'Docs Like Code' over an enterprise Component Content Management System (CCMS) depends on various factors, including the nature of the project, the team's skillset, the content's complexity, and the intended workflow. Let's explore some reasons why one might opt for 'Docs Like Code':

1. **Integration with Software Development Processes**: 'Docs Like Code' is particularly beneficial in environments where documentation is closely tied to software development. This approach integrates documentation into the same version control systems (like Git) used for code, making it easier to keep documentation in sync with software updates.

2. **Collaboration and Contribution**: This method encourages contributions from a broader range of team members, including developers, product managers, and even users. Since it uses tools familiar to developers (like GitHub or GitLab), it can lead to more collaborative and iterative development of documentation.

3. **Automation and Continuous Integration/Deployment**: 'Docs Like Code' allows for the use of continuous integration tools. Documentation can be automatically tested, built, and deployed alongside the software, ensuring consistency and reducing manual errors.

4. **Lower Cost and Open Tools**: Many tools used in 'Docs Like Code' are open source and free, which can be a cost-effective solution compared to some CCMS platforms. This can be a significant factor, especially for smaller teams or projects with limited budgets.

5. **Flexibility and Scalability**: This approach can be more flexible and scalable, particularly for technical documentation. It supports various output formats (like HTML, PDF, etc.) and can be easily adapted as the project evolves.

However, it's important to consider the potential drawbacks:

- **Learning Curve**: For teams not familiar with development tools like Git, there's a learning curve involved. This might require training or hiring personnel with specific skill sets.
  
- **Lack of Advanced Content Management Features**: Unlike a CCMS, 'Docs Like Code' might not offer advanced features like translation management, granular permission controls, or content reuse across different documents as efficiently.

- **Workflow Complexity**: For non-technical contributors, the workflow can be more complex compared to the more user-friendly interfaces of a CCMS.

In summary, 'Docs Like Code' is a valuable approach for teams closely aligned with software development processes, prioritizing collaboration, automation, and integration with software CI/CD pipelines. However, for content that requires sophisticated management, complex workflows, and is targeted at a non-technical audience, an enterprise CCMS might be more appropriate.
