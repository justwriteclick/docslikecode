I've been working hard on a new book with two collaborators, Diane Skwish and Kelly Holcomb, titled "Docs Like Code." We're editing and organizing like mad now, working hard to get all our experiences and best practices written down for the world to see. So I ask you, what do you want to know about writing docs like code?

Here are some of the topics:

* Why use GitHub for docs?
* Information architecture
* Workflows
* Author and build content
* Quality assurance
* Review
* Automate builds
* Lessons learned
* Tutorials: Get started with docs like code
* What about wikis?

When you treat docs as code, what are your biggest barriers? Your looming concerns? Let me know so we can address these. Sign up below to learn more together.
