Let's take a look at what docs as code looks like in practice.

The basic steps on a Mac are:

1. Make sure you have all the pre-requisites set up for Ruby, Jekyll, and Bundler. [Set up GitHub Pages locally](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/) as instructed in the excellent GitHub documentation.
1. Clone a repository that contains a Jekyll theme that you like. We're using the [so-simple theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/) here.
1. Switch to the cloned git directory.
1. Run `bundle install` to install the required gems.
1. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to serve the content from a local web server.
1. Copy and paste the `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` URL into your web browser.

This video shows you how to clone a GitHub repo with an existing Jekyll theme and build it locally.
