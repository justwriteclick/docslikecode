In the new year I want to keep learning more about docs like code, and I know that I've learned a lot from the Write the Docs community and presentations.

Top of mind for me right now is that the 2018 conference in Portland Oregon is in May, 6-8 to be exact, and the [call for proposals closes next Wednesday](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2018/cfp/), January 10, 2018. You can register and buy your ticket - or tickets for your whole team - [online now](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2018/).

Even when I don't make it to the conference in person, the video recordings are super helpful to learn from others. Here's a collection of the relevant talks over the years:

### 2017 US conference

[Jodie Putrino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzu-c-FoOdw) presented “Treating documentation like code: a practical account” to share her experiences at F5 Networks.

### 2016 US conference

[A panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2TGwUPb8R4) of folks from Rackspace, Microsoft, Balsamiq, and Twitter talked about how they are adopting these practices.

### 2016 EU conference

[Margaret Eker and Jennifer Roundeau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvRd7MmAxPw) talked about the "Missing Manual" for docs like code.

[Rachel Whitten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHdBsNxtKeI) talked about docs-as-code in practice.

### 2015 US conference

[Riona MacNamara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnB8GtPuauw) spoke about how adopting docs like code has completely transformed how Google does documentation.

All this to say, the docs-like-code concepts are widely practiced in our industry, and each conference provides more inspiring examples. Perhaps you can watch these presentations and be inspired to integrate code and doc techniques.
